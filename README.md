# Dynamic City and River Generation

## Project Overview
This project involves the creation of cities and rivers on a dynamically generated map. The map generation process includes the creation of rivers first, followed by the placement of cities at suitable locations.

## Special Notes
- Cities can only be created after rivers have been generated. To place a city, wait for the rivers to form and then click the left mouse button. Note that sometimes the first click might not result in a city being created if a suitable location is not found. In such cases, click again until a city is placed.
- Occasionally, the chosen point might be between two rivers, resulting in insufficient space for a city. This may require adjusting the point of creation.

## Instructions for Running the Project
1. **Generating Rivers:** 
   - Ensure that rivers are generated before attempting to create cities. The project relies on the presence of rivers to determine suitable locations for city placement.

2. **Creating Cities:**
   - Click the left mouse button to attempt city creation. If the city is not created on the first click, try clicking again.
   - Be aware that the location might not always be ideal, especially if it's between two rivers. If no city is created, adjust the click location.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the dynamic generation of natural and man-made structures on a map. The addition of bridges and the detailed handling of creation points between rivers adds depth and complexity to the simulation.
